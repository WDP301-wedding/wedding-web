# Wedding Public Web

Next.js application for the public website, Guest invitation/RSVP flows, and Couple web experiences. It consumes the backend contract and never owns database access, privileged credentials, or authoritative business rules.

For the complete four-repository setup and contract workflow, see the backend-owned [cross-repository development guide](https://github.com/WDP301-wedding/wedding-be/blob/main/docs/cross-repo-development.md).

## Quick start

Requires Node.js 24.21.0 (see `.node-version`) and npm 11.x.

```powershell
npm ci
Copy-Item .env.example .env.local
npm run dev -- --port 3000
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`. The default environment points to the backend at `http://localhost:3001`.

`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` is public browser configuration. Use only a local loopback HTTP URL in development and HTTPS elsewhere. Never place a database URL, service-role key, provider key, bearer token, or other credential in a `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variable.

## API contract

The generated type declaration at `src/lib/api/generated/schema.d.ts` comes from the backend OpenAPI artifact pinned by exact commit and SHA-256 digest in `api-contract.lock.json`. Keep `wedding-web` and `wedding-be` as sibling directories for the default local source.

```powershell
npm run api:check
npm run api:generate
```

Run `api:check` for normal verification. Run `api:generate` only after the backend contract has been committed and the lock file has been updated to that immutable artifact. Never hand-edit the generated schema.

| `npm run test` / `npm run test:unit` | Run Vitest tests                                |
| `npm run test:coverage`              | Run the coverage gate                           |
| `npm run api:generate`               | Regenerate the typed API schema                 |
| `npm run api:check`                  | Verify the locked artifact and committed schema |
| `npm run format:check`               | Check Prettier formatting                       |

## Troubleshooting

- If browser requests fail, confirm the backend is on port 3001 and includes `http://localhost:3000` in `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`.
- A digest mismatch means the local OpenAPI file is not the artifact recorded in `api-contract.lock.json`; do not bypass it. Update the lock only after the backend contract commit exists.
- Production builds reject a cleartext non-loopback API URL. Use HTTPS outside local development.
