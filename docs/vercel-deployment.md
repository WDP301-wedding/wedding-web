# Vercel deployment

Production project: `bach-le-ba-s-projects/wedding-web`.

Production URL: <https://wedding-web-silk.vercel.app>.

Set the Vercel **production** environment variable
`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://wedding-web-silk.vercel.app/api/v1` before
building. Public variables are embedded at build time; changing them requires a
new deployment. Keep local `.env.local` for local development only.

`vercel.json` proxies `/api/v1/*` to the Railway backend. Browser requests and
the backend's Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite=Lax host refresh cookie therefore use
the web origin. Keep this exact origin in Railway `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`; its
first entry is also the origin used for email credential links. Never add
Supabase service credentials, Brevo credentials, or backend secrets to this web.

The project uses Node 24.x, `npm ci`, and `npm run build`. Deploy the reviewed
source using the authenticated Vercel CLI:

```powershell
vercel link --yes --scope bach-le-ba-s-projects --project wedding-web
vercel deploy --dry --json
vercel deploy --prod --yes --scope bach-le-ba-s-projects
```

Inspect the dry-run file list before uploading: `.env*`, private keys,
credentials, Git metadata, and local build output must be excluded by
`.vercelignore`. The CLI can add an OIDC token to local `.env.local`; never
commit or upload that file. Git auto-deployment is not configured by this setup.

After deployment, verify `/`, `/halls`, `/account`, `/reset-password`, and
`/api/v1/catalog/halls`. An unauthenticated refresh request must return 401,
not a CORS denial. Inspect production at desktop and mobile widths.

For later releases, record the previous successful deployment URL before
publishing. Use `vercel rollback <previous-deployment-url>` or promote the
previous deployment in the dashboard to restore it. This first deployment has
no earlier release to restore.
